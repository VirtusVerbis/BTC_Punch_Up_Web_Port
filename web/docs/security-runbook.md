- Capture logs and reproduction details.
- Validate CSP and security headers from deployed edge.
- Roll back to latest healthy deployment if regression was introduced.

## Dependency vulnerability handling

- Patch with minimal compatible versions.
- Run `npm run test`, `npm run lint`, and `npm run build`.
- Redeploy and monitor.

## Communication template
